<ul>
  <li><b>1995 (approx)</b> - Canberra, the Nation's capital - born</li>
  <li><b>1998 (approx) </b>- move to Sydney with owner Kylie</li>
  <li><b>March 2001</b> - Diane's first meeting with Tuxy, when she, friend (not) Noah the cat and owner Kylie move into 260 Wilson St</li>
	<li><b>very soon after March 2001</b>  - Tuxy befriends Diane taking comfort in sharing her bed to get away from Noah</li>
  <li><b>Sept 2001</b> - Kylie takes off overseas with her friend Emma, Tuxy and Noah adopted by Diane</li>
  <li><b>March 2003</b> - Diane, Tuxy and Noah relocate to NZ.  Move into apartment at Diane's parents place north of Auckland - the meeting of Millie the cat</li>
  <li><b>17 August 2003</b> - tragic death of Noah, drowned in family swimming pool.  He is not at all missed by Tuxy</li>
  <li><b>2004</b> - Diane and Tuxy move out to own unit in South Auckland</li>
  <li><b>2006</b> - South Auckland apartment is rented out, Diane and Tuxy move back to family apartment much to dismay of both Tuxy and Millie</li>
  <li><b>January 2007</b> - Diane relocates to Sydney, Tuxy stays in NZ with ever supportive parents waiting till Diane has moved to new permanent home </li>
  <li><b>February 2007</b> - Tuxy relocates to Sydney, to her new home on lower North Shore.  Delighted to be only cat - not only in own home, but in whole block of 7 terraces, much adored by all who cross her path while she basks in the sun on the driveway</li>
  <li><b>February 2010</b> - Diane and Tuxy move out of North Shore mansion, to Diane's new apartment in city.  End of the indoor outdoor life for Tuxy but she adapts amazingly well after the disappointment of the first day meowing at the front door, being let out, only to find a small concrete foyer and not the grass and trees of the big wide world.</li>
  <li><b>November 2016</b> - Tuxy's health is deteriorating due to kidney disease.  Gives Diane a big scare needing to stay 
  overnight at vets on IV.  But she pulls through this time</li>
<li><b>2 February 2017</b> - A long happy life comes to an end as a second time needing to be on IV overnight is too much.  Tuxy succumbs to her kidney disease and is euthanased at Alexandria Vets.   Diane in mourning.</li>
<li><b>12 March 2017</b> - new love and joy into Diane's life with the adoption of 2 new babies from <a target="_blank" href="https://mkc.org.au/">Millie Kitty Commune</a>.  But soulmate Tuxy will never be replaced, missed and loved forever </li>
